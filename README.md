# hix_CheckoutPage

This project focuses on crafting a responsive checkout page for an e-commerce platform utilizing React. The primary objective is to enable users to seamlessly navigate through the checkout process by incorporating a visually appealing interface. Upon clicking the "Checkout" button, the page will initiate a POST request to the backend, transmitting specific item details. This task serves as an evaluation of proficiency in React development, encompassing state management, API integration, testing, and front-end design.
